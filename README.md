## Project Overview

This project implements a complete end-to-end machine learning workflow using **KizenML** and **Explainable AI (XAI)** tools. The workflow includes data preprocessing, model training, explainability using XAI, and deployment on cloud services. 

The repository contains all the code required for data collection and preprocessing, model selection and training, explainable AI techniques, and cloud deployment. The project is divided into the following steps:

---

## 1. Data Collection and Preprocessing (4 Marks)

### Dataset:
- Iris Dataset

### Preprocessing:
- Data cleaning, feature engineering, and scaling/normalization were performed using **KizenML** (or other tools).

---

## 2. Model Selection, Training, and Hyperparameter Tuning (6 Marks)

### Model Selection:
- Multiple models were trained and evaluated.

### Hyperparameter Tuning:
- Hyperparameters were tuned using **AutoML/KizenML**.

---

## 3. Explainable AI (XAI) Implementation (6 Marks)

### XAI Techniques:
- **SHAP** and **LIME** were used to interpret the modelâ€™s predictions.
- These techniques provided insights into the feature importance and decision-making process.

## 4. Model Deployment Using Cloud Services (6 Marks)

### Cloud Service:
- **Azure Functions** was used for deploying the model API.
